## 🏛️ Demo: The Golden Architect

A structure-building simulation based on a target image, with limited costs.

### 🏠 About the Game

"The Golden Architect" is a simulation game where the player is required to build stable and balanced structures according to a given **target image**, all within a **limited budget**.

The player's goal is to design and build a structure that is both **structurally sound** and as **cost-effective** as possible.

The player can use tools (like concrete and a hammer) and building materials (like walls and doors) to assemble the structure in the center of the screen.

### ✨ Scoring and Objective

The final score will be awarded based on three main criteria:

1.  **Structural Stability:** (Points are deducted for incorrect material usage or failure to use mandatory tools).
2.  **Correct Material Use:** (Such as the mandatory use of concrete for the floor and a minimum of two walls).
3.  **Total Cost:** (Points are deducted for exceeding the defined budget).

To successfully **pass the level**, the player must achieve a total score of **over 80 points**.

### 🛠️ Controls and Interaction

* **Using Materials (Warehouse):** Click on the desired material (Wall, Door, Roof) using the left mouse button. The material will appear in the center of the screen and can be placed by **dragging** it with the mouse.
